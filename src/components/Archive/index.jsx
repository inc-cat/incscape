              Actually finished in November 2021. Before I moved to the north of
              England, every time I would travel to places like Manchester, it'd
              always be raining. My friend lived in a high rise by a busy road
              and I'd just watch cars pass by during the evenings when things
              were quiet. It always felt other wordly and I can't really explain
              why but it was more of me just feeling like I was watching it rain
              from outer space where the streets of Manchester were isolated
              from me and my surroundings.{' '}

              It had been such a long time since I put music out, normally I set
              a day aside to finalise tracks and add processing to make
              everything sound as good as it possibly can. However since moving
              to the north of England I have left all of my equipment in London
              and until I started this project, I hadn't really made much music
              at all. I decided that I needed to make music again or I'd just
              fall out of making music in total. I thought the best idea was to
              continue with an idea I have had on the backburner for a few years
              now. I had always wanted to make an "Impressions" series but never
              really got around to doing it as creativity can be all over the
              place for me. I can hardly ever just finish a project without
              going off into many directions and because of this I have many
              unfinished albums that can progress at the oddest times or just
              stay as 1 track.

              For this project, instead of music that I felt was more up to date
              with the short game ideas I had in my head, i decided to take it
              back to the hayday of the PS2, around the time Ratchet and Clank
              came out. A lot of game soundtracks were instrumental in inspiring
              and shaping this project. After being so long out of making music,
              this project came together quite quickly and even through simply
              playing around at time, I feel I made some good work here.{' '}

              Looking back on this album, I'm not sure I know much about how I
              felt making it. This was just me making music about my rush hour
              commute to work. I'd run from the DLR platforms to the Jubilee
              line and be sandwiched into a small train from Canning Town to
              Canada Water and then board an Overground train to get me to work.
              When I wanted a seat, I'd board a train in the wrong direction and
              go back 1 stop (West Ham) to make sure I got a seat. I don't have
              fond memories of rush hour travelling. Each song is a mish mash of
              my my thoughts about those minutes of my morning.
